Legal style modules for the Juris-M reference manager

----------------

This repository has been archived.

The functionality formerly provided by the Myles plugin
has been integrated into Jurism itself.

See the [Jurism repository](https://github.com/juris-m/zotero) and the
[Jurism documentation](https://juris-m.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for
details on modular style support.
